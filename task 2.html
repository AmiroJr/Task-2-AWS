<h2> 2. Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) </h2> 
<DIV> Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This makes it a popular choice for storing and retrieving any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. </DIV> 
<h3> Functioning </h3> 
<ol> 
<li> You create an Amazon S3 bucket, which is a logical container for storing your data. You can create as many buckets as you need, and each bucket can store an unlimited amount of data. </li> 
<li> You upload objects (e.g., documents, images, videos) to your bucket. Each object is stored as a file, and you can organize your objects using a hierarchical file structure called a "prefix." </li>
<li> You can access your objects using a variety of methods, including the Amazon S3 API, the AWS Management Console, and third-party tools. You can also set up policies to control access to your objects, such as allowing or denying access based on the user's identity or the type of request. </li> 
<li> Amazon S3 stores your objects in a highly scalable and durable manner. It stores your data across multiple facilities and devices, and it replicates your data within and across regions to provide high availability and durability. </li>

<h2><u><center> What are AWS Cost and Usage Reports ? </center></u></h2> 
<h3><center> The AWS Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) contains the most comprehensive set of cost and usage data available. You can use Cost and Usage Reports to publish your AWS billing reports to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you own.  </center> </h3>
<h3><center>You can receive reports that break down your costs by the hour, day, or month, by product or product resource, or by tags that you define yourself. AWS updates the report in your bucket once a day in comma-separated value (CSV) format. You can view the reports using spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Apache OpenOffice Calc, or access them from an application using the Amazon S3 API.
AWS Cost and Usage Reports tracks your AWS usage and provides estimated charges associated with your account. Each report contains line items for each unique combination of AWS products, usage type, and operation that you use in your AWS account. You can customize the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to aggregate the information either by the hour, day, or month.
<center></h3>
<h2> Amazon EC2 usage reports </h2> 
<DIV>AWS provides a free reporting tool called AWS Cost Explorer that enables you to analyse the cost and usage of your EC2 instances and the usage of your Reserved Instances. You can view data up to the last 13 months, and forecast how much you are likely to spend for the next three months. You can use Cost Explorer to see patterns in how much you spend on AWS resources over time, identify areas that need further inquiry, and see trends that you can use to understand your costs. You also can specify time ranges for the data, and view time data by day or by month.</DIV>

<h2> Setting up an Amazon S3 bucket for Cost and Usage Reports </h2> 
<DIV>To receive billing reports, you must have an Amazon S3 bucket in your AWS account to receive and store your reports. When setting up a Cost and Usage Report in the billing console you can select an existing Amazon S3 bucket you own or setup up a new one. In either case, you’ll be asked to review and confirm the application of the following default bucket policy. Editing this policy in the Amazon S3 console or changing the bucket owner after you’ve setup a Cost and Usage Report will prevent AWS from being able to deliver your reports. Storing the billing reports data in your Amazon S3 bucket is billed at standard Amazon S3 rates. </DIV>

<h2> Case Study on AWS Web Development services </h2>
<h3> E-Travel </h3>
<DIV>One of the top 10 online travel agencies in Europe, e-Travel operates 11 websites, including www.mytrip.com, www.airtickets24.com, and www.trip.ru. Since mid-2014, more than two million passengers worldwide have purchased flights, travel insurance, and car rental services through the Athens-based start-up. Launched in 2007, the 180-employee company has a significant presence in south-eastern Europe and Russia and is expanding into markets in Southeast Asia.  </DIV>
<h3> The challenge </h3> 
<DIV>E-Travel has three core business goals: quick time to market, expansion into new countries and regions, and continuous delivery of useful features for customers. Focusing on these has been central to the firm’s success, so when its existing IT infrastructure—a combination of collocated and managed hosting services—hampered the company’s ambitions, e-Travel knew it had to look differently at its IT setup.
“As we grew, we found that our environment was slowing us down,” says Nick Bitounis, director of IT at e-Travel. “We were concentrating on provisioning hardware, but what we really wanted to do was help deliver a great experience to our customers.” Bitounis says process automation was key in enabling the start up’s 35-plus in-house developers to experiment and test new ideas instead of focusing on day-to-day IT management tasks.
With a 24/7 operation serving customers in more than 60 countries, e-Travel also needed to ensure high availability as well as elasticity to cope with significant spikes in demand. In 2012, things came to a head, with several hardware failures that ultimately threatened the customer experience. “Our most pressing goal was to eliminate downtime altogether,” says Bitounis.
e-Travel looked to the cloud to help it achieve the service continuity that was so vital to its business.  
 </DIV>
<h3> WHy AWS ? </h3>
<DIV>e-Travel uses AWS to run all its back-end systems for flight bookings and ticketing, as well as its 11 customer-facing websites. The services sit within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), and include Amazon elastic cloud (Amazon EC2), with Elastic Load balancing for distributing loads between instances. Amazon SNS (Amazon S3) provides fully redundant storage, and the managed Amazon relational database (Amazon RDS) reduces manual database administration for the team.
e-Travel uses Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS to pass data between applications. The firm’s developers make extensive use of tools for Amazon Web Services, including the AWS SDK for ruby and AWS SDK for .NET to help integrate the company’s applications with its AWS environment.
Amazon cloud search provides data indexing for the company’s proprietary customer relationship management (CRM) application, while is central to Amazon kinesis streaming log data. e-Travel hopes to expand its use of Amazon red shift for management reporting and is currently exploring how it can use AWS Lambda to realize the benefits of a serverless architecture.
The company has the Business support plan from AWS Support, which Bitounis says has been helpful. “When the need arises, the response times, feedback, and resolution have been good,” he says.  
 <DIV> 
<h3> Benefits </h3>
<DIV>Eliminating system downtime was a key driver for moving to the cloud. “With AWS, we have 99.99 percent availability, which helps us deliver a consistent, reliable experience for our customers,” says Bitounis.
The company’s sites all experience fluctuations in demand on an hourly, daily, and seasonal basis, and the elasticity of AWS gives e-Travel the ability to deal with these spikes in traffic. Bitounis says, “By using AWS, we can scale flexibly without having to spend time manually adding servers or removing bottlenecks. The infrastructure can easily respond to changes in demand.”

<h3> Reddit on AWS </h3>

<DIV> Reddit has been operating on AWS since 2009. Originally, to support data that powered Reddit.com ad the company’s native mobile apps, Reddit used a self-managed PostgreSQL database on Amazon EC2, which provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 gave Reddit’s engineers complete control of their computing resources as well as easy-to-use management features that enabled them to organize their data and configure finely tuned access controls to meet business, organizational, and compliance requirements. </DIV> 
<BR>
<DIV> Reddit uses Amazon Aurora, managed by Amazon RDS, which automates time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning and database setup, patching, and backups. Amazon Aurora granted Reddit engineers the to replicate its databases from Amazon EC2 without the need for transformation. Furthermore, they used Amazon Aurora to build a longer-term strategy for how they would deal with data and do more strategic thinking for lon-term projects. </DIV>		
<BR>
<DIV> Migrating from self-managed PostgreSQL on Amazon EC2 to Aurora was a key component of Reddit’s success. It has resulted in not only higher database reliability, faster backup restoration and point-in-time recovery, and fast automated failovers but also improved productivity for engineers. </DIV>
